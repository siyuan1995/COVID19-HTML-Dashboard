# COVID19 social media dashboard
A web mapping dashboard for monitoring COVID19 status through social media like Twitter, developed using ArcGIS API for JavaScript. Just open the HTML you can see the dashboard running. I know that put logic code inside HTML is not the best way to implement an application, I did this just for easy deployment.

Functionality:

•	Sync double map, drag or zoom one of the map the other map will drag or zoom in a sync way.

•	The center area is the map, it displays the basemap and data layer.

•	For each feature in the layer, you can click it to pop up attribute information.

•	Click the square icon on the top left to enable polygon select, click the map to start drawing, double click on the map to finish drawing. Features inside this polygon will be selected. Click the square icon again to run a new polygon select.

•	The white area at the bottom is to show selected featuers’ attribute information and click the row to highlight the corresponding feature on the map.

•	The pie chart and bar chart display language distribution, and country distribution of selected features, hover your mouse on the charts to see detailed information.

•	The attribute area and charts are changing responsively with the selected features.

•	Click the circle icon below square icon on the top left to see heatmap view of the data.
