# COVID19 social media dashboard
A web mapping dashboard for monitoring COVID19 status through social media like Twitter, developed using ArcGIS API for JavaScript. Just open the HTML you can see the dashboard running. I know that put logic code inside HTML is not the best way to implement an application, I did this just for easy deployment.
